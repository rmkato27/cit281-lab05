This lab involves downloading and installing Postman, creating a CIT 281 collection, setting up a Node.js and Fastify server to handle GET and POST requests with JSON responses, and using Postman to test these functionalities

similar to lab 4 this lab was able to teach me more about the back end portion of webdev. I was able to use postman for the first time, and using this was able to test code by using the specific urls. like cit/student/id for example.
