This lab involves downloading and installing Postman, creating a CIT 281 collection, setting up a Node.js and Fastify server to handle GET and POST requests with JSON responses, and using Postman to test these functionalities

this lab really showed the back end coding part of a webpage, i really learned alot during this lab and subsequent project, because I was able to see how the server code and html code and module codes interacted with each other in this lab and project. Usingg Fastify to create a url and actual webpage was cool.
